# Switch mode power supply for RC-TANK
Subproject of switch mode power supply for use in my RC-TANK project. Power supply should be able to convert battery voltage to suitable voltages for DC motors, logic, servomechanisms and DC fans.
### Requirements:

1. Input voltage 12.5V - 35V  
2. Output voltages  

| Voltage | Maximum current |
|--------|--------|
| 7.4 [V]   | 40 [A] |
| 5 [V]     |  5 [A] |
| 6 [V]     | 20 [A] |
| 12 [V]   | 20 [A] |

3. Overcurrent protection, overtemperature protection, undervoltage protection
